└── requirements.txt                # Dependencies
```

## 🧠 **Phase 1: Query Intelligence (COMPLETED)**

### **1. Query Enhancement (`/enhance-query`)**
- **Query expansion** with technical term alternatives
- **Spelling correction** for common technical terms  
- **Query suggestions** based on intent patterns
- **Confidence scoring** for enhancement quality
- **Caching** for performance (30-minute TTL)

**Example:**
```bash
Input: "python machien learning"
Output: {
  "enhanced_query": "python machine learning OR (\"ML\" OR \"AI\" OR \"python3\")",
  "corrections": [{"original": "machien", "suggestion": "machine"}],
  "suggestions": ["python machine learning tutorial", "python ML examples"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### **2. Intent Classification (`/classify-intent`)**
- **7 intent categories**: tutorial, troubleshooting, reference, comparison, example, general
- **Pattern-based detection** with regex matching
- **Confidence scoring** and suggested filters
- **Multi-intent support** with scoring

**Example:**
```bash
Input: "how to fix python error"
Output: {
  "primary_intent": "troubleshooting",
  "confidence": 0.67,
  "suggested_filters": ["solution", "debugging", "error-resolution"]
}
```

### **3. Entity Extraction (`/extract-entities`)**
- **Technology detection**: Python, JavaScript, React, Docker, etc.
- **Level identification**: beginner, intermediate, advanced
- **Content type detection**: tutorial, documentation, example, etc.
- **Framework recognition**: React, Vue, Angular, etc.

**Example:**
```bash
Input: "react hooks tutorial for beginners"
Output: {
  "entities": {
    "technologies": ["react"],
    "levels": ["beginner"],
    "content_types": ["tutorial"],
    "frameworks": ["react"]
  }
}
```

## 📊 **Phase 2: Content Analysis (COMPLETED)**

### **4. Content Analysis (`/analyze-content`)**
- **Quality distribution** analysis across all results
- **Content type classification** (7 types)
- **Domain authority analysis** with scoring
- **Topic clustering** and keyword extraction
- **Freshness analysis** with year detection
- **Authority signal detection**

### **5. Quality Scoring (`/score-quality`)**
- **6-factor quality assessment**:
  - Technical depth (25% weight)
  - Authority signals (20% weight)
  - Content freshness (15% weight)
  - User engagement (10% weight)
  - Readability (15% weight)
  - Completeness (15% weight)
- **Domain authority boost** for trusted sources
- **Quality tier classification** (high/medium-high/medium/low-medium/low)

### **6. Result Reranking (`/rerank-results`)**
- **Multi-factor ranking algorithm**:
  - Quality score (40% weight)
  - Query relevance (50% weight)
  - Position bias (10% weight)
- **Ranking change tracking** with explanations
- **Score distribution analysis**

### **7. Duplicate Detection (`/detect-duplicates`)**
- **Exact duplicate detection** via content signatures
- **Near-duplicate detection** using title similarity (80% threshold)
- **Similarity scoring** and classification

## 🎯 **Comprehensive Insights (`/generate-insights`)**

### **8. Unified Analysis Engine**
Combines ALL capabilities into a single endpoint:
- Query analysis with enhancement, intent, and entities
- Content insights with quality and type analysis
- Authority signal detection
- Smart recommendations based on combined analysis

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

### **Response Times** (All sub-5ms for typical queries)
- Query Enhancement: ~0.2-0.5ms
- Intent Classification: ~2-3ms  
- Entity Extraction: ~1-2ms
- Content Analysis: ~5-8ms
- Quality Scoring: ~2-3ms
- Comprehensive Insights: ~3-5ms

### **Caching Implementation**
- **Query Intelligence**: 30-minute cache TTL
- **Content Analysis**: 1-hour cache TTL
- **In-memory caching** with automatic cleanup
- **Cache hit logging** for monitoring

## 🛡️ **Enhanced Health Monitoring**

### **Multi-Service Health Checks**
