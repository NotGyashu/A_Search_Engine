🚀 HYBRID SPEED CRAWLER - Production-Ready Ultimate Performance
================================================================
Configuration - Phase 2 Enhanced:
- Network workers: 8
- HTML processors: 4
- Max crawl depth: 3
- Max queue size: 10000
- Target performance: 300+ pages/sec
- Phase 2 features: Sharded disk, Work stealing, HTML pipeline
================================================================

🔧 Initializing proxy system for 200-500+ pages/sec performance...
📋 Added 3 free proxy endpoints (disabled by default)
💡 To enable proxies, edit config/proxy_config.json and set enabled: true
📋 Loaded proxy configuration with 3 endpoints
🔧 Applying proxy configuration...
⏸️  Skipped disabled proxy: free_us_1
⏸️  Skipped disabled proxy: free_eu_1
⏸️  Skipped disabled proxy: socks5_proxy_1
📊 Proxy configuration applied: 0/3 proxies active
✅ Proxy system initialized successfully
- Total proxies: 0
- Healthy proxies: 0
- Domain sharding: ENABLED
- Target performance: 50 req/sec per proxy
⚠️  No healthy proxies available - using direct connections
💡 To enable proxies:
   1. Edit config/proxy_config.json
   2. Add working proxy endpoints
   3. Set enabled: true for proxy endpoints
================================================================

✅ Seeded hybrid crawler with 33/33 URLs
