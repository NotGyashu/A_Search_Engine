❌ Poor heading structure display
❌ No advanced technical content scoring

### After Ultra Quality Improvements:
✅ **Keywords**: 100% technical/meaningful terms only
✅ **Chunk Size**: Average 256-293 words (well above 75-word minimum)
✅ **Quality Scores**: Average 2.12-2.15 (well above 1.5 threshold)
✅ **Technical Content**: Advanced scoring for programming concepts
✅ **Heading Structure**: Perfect H1/H2/H3 hierarchy preservation
